# alovesoshir

alovesoshir is a wedding website for my sister and now brother-in-law, written in pure Ruby without any frameworks or testing libraries. This is the first side project that I have undertaken upon completing my bootcamp with Le Wagon, which I treated it as a small wedding gift to the couple as well as an opportunity to refresh my coding knowledge.

A second version will be launched shortly with photos taken during the day.

Feel free to check it out at http://www.alovesoshir.


## Built With

* [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) - the web framework used
